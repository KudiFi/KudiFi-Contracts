# ⚡️ KudiFi

KudiFi is a smart contract protocol on APE Chain enabling Ghanaian users to manage crypto via USSD, offering seamless token transfers with mobile money integration.

With KudiFi users don’t need to create a wallet (metamask, etc), rather KudiFi converts a user's phone number into a blockchain address. 

This instantly puts a lot of people subscribed to mobile services in Africa on the blockchain.
